# 🔧 Ticket Complaint Clustering & Technician Allocation Optimization

This project uses real-world complaint ticket data to perform **geospatial clustering** and create an efficient **technician deployment plan** across urban service hubs. The goal is to improve field service management by visualizing hotspots of complaints, calculating technician workloads, and recommending optimal manpower deployment based on ticket density.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In high-density cities with growing electric vehicle usage, handling customer complaints efficiently requires a data-driven approach. This project addresses the challenge by:
- Clustering complaint locations using **Folium + MarkerCluster**
- Visualizing ticket volumes by **geo-coordinates and sub-areas**
- Analyzing ticket density and aligning technicians based on workload
- Planning the number of technicians required per region for SLA compliance

## 🗺️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - `folium` for interactive maps
  - `folium.plugins.MarkerCluster` for geo-point clustering
- **Pandas & Google Sheets** for ticket data preparation
- **Excel** for operational planning
- **Leaflet.js** (via Folium) for rendering HTML maps
- **VSCode** (used for prototyping)

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📍 **Map-Based Clustering**  
  Visualizes all ticket locations and clusters them to identify complaint hotspots.

- 📊 **Hub/Sub-Area Planning**  
  Each complaint is grouped under a defined **hub and sub-area** based on service zones.

- 👨‍🔧 **Technician Load Estimation**  
  Uses ticket volume and average resolution capacity (8 tickets/day/tech) to recommend number of technicians needed.

- 📈 **Data-Driven Service Optimization**  
  Helps reduce complaint resolution time by improving resource allocation and zone coverage.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- 🔥 Add **heatmaps** to visualize intensity of complaints.
- 📆 Automate monthly summary reports from raw ticket dumps.
- 🚀 Build a **dashboard** using Looker Studio or Plotly Dash.
- 📱 Integrate mobile app location tracking for real-time technician assignment.
